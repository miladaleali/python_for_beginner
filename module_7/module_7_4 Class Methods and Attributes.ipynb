    "## Introduction to Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A class method is a method that is bound to the class rather than the object of the class. A class method can access or modify the class state, but not the instance state. A class method is useful for creating factory methods that can create different objects of the class with different parameters, or for defining methods that are relevant to the class as a whole, rather than a specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class method in Python, we use the @classmethod decorator, which is a built-in function that modifies the behavior of the method. The first parameter of a class method is cls, which points to the class, and not the object. For example, to define a class method called from_string for the Person class, which creates a person object from a string, we can write:\n",

A class attribute can be used to store information or state that is common to all objects of the class, such as constants, default values, or counters. A class attribute can be accessed or modified by using either the class name or the object name, followed by a dot and the attribute name.\n",
