    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a principle of object-oriented programming that means hiding the internal details and state of an object from the outside world, and providing a clear and simple interface to interact with the object. Encapsulation ensures that the object's data and behavior are consistent and valid, and that they cannot be accessed or modified by unauthorized or unintended ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can achieve encapsulation by using access modifiers, which are prefixes that indicate the level of access or visibility of an attribute or a method. There are three types of access modifiers in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public: This means that the attribute or method can be accessed by anyone, inside or outside the class. By default, all attributes and methods in Python are public, unless specified otherwise. We do not need to use any prefix for public attributes or methods. For example, the name and age attributes of the Person class are public, and can be accessed by anyone.\n",

To indicate that an attribute or method is protected, we use a single underscore prefix, such as _name or _age. This is a convention, not a rule, and it does not prevent the access or modification of the attribute or method, but it signals that it is intended for internal use only. For example, the _species attribute of the Animal class is protected, and can be accessed only by the Animal class and its subclasses, such as Dog or Cat.\n",

To indicate that an attribute or method is private, we use a double underscore prefix, such as __name or __age. This is also known as name mangling, because Python will automatically change the name of the attribute or method to _ClassName__name or _ClassName__age, where ClassName is the name of the class. This is done to avoid name conflicts with subclasses or other classes that may have the same attribute or method name. For example, the __password attribute of the User class is private, and can be accessed only by the User class itself, and not by anyone else.\n",

    "In Python, we can achieve abstraction by using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but can only be inherited by other classes. An abstract class defines some abstract methods, which are methods that have no implementation, but only a signature. The subclasses of the abstract class must implement the abstract methods, or they will also become abstract. To create an abstract class in Python, we need to import the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module, and use the @abstractmethod decorator to mark the abstract methods. For example, to create an abstract class called Shape, which defines an abstract method called area, we can write:\n",
