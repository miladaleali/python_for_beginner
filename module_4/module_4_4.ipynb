    "A module is a file that contains Python code, such as definitions of functions, variables, classes, or other objects. Modules allow us to group related code together and reuse it in different programs. For example, we can create a module that contains functions for performing mathematical operations, and import it in any program that needs those functions.\n",

    "To create a module, we simply need to save our Python code in a file with a .py extension. The name of the file is the name of the module. For example, if we save our code in a file called math_functions.py, the name of the module is math_functions.\n",
