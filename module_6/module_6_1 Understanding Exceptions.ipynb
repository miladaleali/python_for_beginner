    "## What are Exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are errors or unexpected events that occur during the execution of a program. They disrupt the normal flow of the program and may cause it to terminate abruptly. For example, if we try to divide a number by zero, we will get an exception called ZeroDivisionError, which will stop the program and display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Invalid syntax or indentation\n",
    "- Invalid input or output\n",
    "- Invalid operations or types\n",
    "- Missing or corrupted files or modules\n",
    "- Logical errors or bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be classified into two types: built-in and user-defined. Built-in exceptions are predefined by Python and cover the most common errors. User-defined exceptions are custom exceptions that we can create and raise ourselves to handle specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Python Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a hierarchy of built-in exceptions that inherit from a base class called Exception. Some of the common Python exceptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SyntaxError: This is raised when the syntax of the code is invalid or incorrect. For example, if we forget a colon after a if statement, we will get a SyntaxError.\n",
    "- TypeError: This is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type. For example, if we try to add a string and a number, we will get a TypeError.\n",
    "- ValueError: This is raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value. For example, if we try to convert a string that is not a number to an integer, we will get a ValueError.\n",
    "- IndexError: This is raised when we try to access an element of a sequence or a container that is out of range. For example, if we try to access the fifth element of a list that has only four elements, we will get an IndexError.\n",
    "- KeyError: This is raised when we try to access a value of a dictionary using a key that does not exist. For example, if we try to access the value of a key 'name' in a dictionary that does not have such a key, we will get a KeyError.\n",
    "- FileNotFoundError: This is raised when we try to open or access a file that does not exist or cannot be found. For example, if we try to read a file called 'data.txt' that is not in the current directory, we will get a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "- ImportError: This is raised when we try to import a module that does not exist or cannot be found. For example, if we try to import a module called 'math_functions' that is not in the current directory or the Python path, we will get an ImportError.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more built-in exceptions in Python, and you can find the complete list and their descriptions in the official documentation.\n"
