    "One of the most common tasks in programming is to manipulate data stored in files. Files are collections of data that are stored in a permanent or secondary memory, such as a hard disk, a flash drive, or a CD-ROM. Files can contain text, images, audio, video, or any other type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with files in Python, we need to use the open() function, which takes the name of the file and the mode of operation as arguments, and returns a file object. The mode of operation specifies how we want to access the file, such as reading, writing, appending, or updating. Some of the common modes are:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Text files: These are files that contain plain text, without any formatting or special characters. They usually have a .txt extension. Text files are easy to read and write, but they may not be suitable for complex or structured data.\n",
    "- CSV files: These are files that contain comma-separated values, which are rows of data separated by commas. They usually have a .csv extension. CSV files are useful for storing tabular data, such as spreadsheets or databases. They can be easily imported and exported by various applications, such as Excel or Google Sheets.\n",
    "- JSON files: These are files that contain JavaScript Object Notation, which is a standard format for exchanging data between applications. They usually have a .json extension. JSON files are useful for storing hierarchical or nested data, such as dictionaries or lists. They can be easily parsed and manipulated by various programming languages, such as Python or JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with different file formats in Python, we need to use different modules or libraries that provide the functionality to read and write those formats. For example, to work with CSV files, we can use the csv module, which provides various functions and classes to handle CSV data. For example, to read a CSV file called students.csv, which contains the names and grades of some students, we can write:\n",
