    "Hello and welcome to this video on introduction to web frameworks in Python. In this video, we will learn about some of the most popular and useful web frameworks that can help us create web applications and APIs with Python. We will cover the following topics:\n",

    "- FastAPI for web development, which allows us to create fast and modern web APIs with Python based on standard type hints.\n",
    "- Django for web development, which allows us to create full-featured web applications with Python based on the MVC architecture.\n",

    "## FastAPI for Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard type hints. It has the following key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast to run: It offers very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and pydantic.\n",
    "- Fast to code: It allows for significant increases in development speed.\n",
    "- Reduced number of bugs: It reduces the possibility for human-induced errors.\n",
    "- Intuitive: It offers great editor support, with completion everywhere and less time debugging.\n",
    "- Straightforward: It's designed to be uncomplicated to use and learn, so you can spend less time reading documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use FastAPI, we need to install it in our Python environment. We can use the pip command, which is a tool for managing Python packages. For example, to install FastAPI, we can write:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Model: This is the layer that handles the data and the business logic of the web application. It defines the structure and the behavior of the data, and interacts with the database or other data sources.\n",
    "- View: This is the layer that handles the presentation and the user interface of the web application. It defines how the data is displayed and rendered to the user, and responds to the user input and actions.\n",
    "- Controller: This is the layer that handles the communication and the coordination between the model and the view. It defines the routes and the logic of the web application, and processes the requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django has the following key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batteries included: It comes with many out-of-the-box features, such as ORM, middleware, authentication, admin panel, forms, templates, and more.\n",
    "- Scalable: It can handle high traffic and complex web applications, thanks to its modular and reusable design.\n",
    "- Secure: It provides built-in protection against common web security issues, such as CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, and more.\n",
    "- Versatile: It can be used for various types of web applications, such as e-commerce, social media, content management, and more.\n",
