In this video, we will learn how to use the requests library to send and receive data from web servers using various HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. We will also learn how to handle the responses from the APIs and check their status codes, headers, and content.\n",

    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software components to communicate and exchange data. A web API is a type of API that uses the HTTP protocol to transfer data over the internet. A web API can be accessed by sending an HTTP request to a specific URL, or endpoint, and receiving an HTTP response that contains the requested data, usually in a format such as JSON or XML.\n",
