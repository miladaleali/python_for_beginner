    "To make an API request with the requests library, we can use one of its methods, such as get, post, put, or delete, depending on the HTTP method that the API requires. These methods take the URL of the API endpoint as the first argument, and optionally, other arguments, such as parameters, headers, data, or files, depending on the API specification. These methods return a response object, which contains the status code, headers, and content of the server's response.
