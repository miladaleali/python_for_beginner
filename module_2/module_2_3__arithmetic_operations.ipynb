    "## Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operations are mathematical operations that involve numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. In Python, you can use different operators to perform arithmetic operations on numbers, such as integers and floats. Let's look at some of them in more detail.\n",

    "\n",
    "The basic arithmetic operators in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `+` for addition\n",
    "- `-` for subtraction\n",
    "- `*` for multiplication\n",
    "- `/` for division\n",

    "You can use these operators to calculate the result of an arithmetic expression, such as `2 + 3`, `10 - 5`, `4 * 2`, `8 / 2`, etc. For example:\n"

If you want to get an integer result from division, you can use the floor division operator, which is `//`. For example:\n"

    "### Operator Precedence\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator precedence is the order in which Python evaluates the operators in an arithmetic expression. For example, in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, Python will first evaluate the multiplication, then the addition, and return the result as 14. This is because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, so it is performed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following table to remember the precedence of the arithmetic operators in Python, from highest to lowest:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `**` | Exponentiation |\n",
    "| `*` `/` `//` `%` | Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus |\n",
    "| `+` `-` | Addition, subtraction |\n",
    "\n",
    "If an expression contains operators with the same precedence, Python will evaluate them from left to right. For example, in the expression `10 - 5 + 2`, Python will first evaluate the subtraction, then the addition, and return the result as 7. This is because subtraction and addition have the same precedence, so they are performed from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use parentheses to change the order of operations in an arithmetic expression. For example, if you want to perform the addition before the multiplication in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, you can write `(2 + 3) * 4`, and Python will return the result as 20. This is because parentheses have the highest precedence of all, so they are evaluated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use parentheses to make your expressions more clear and readable, as well as to achieve the desired result. For example, you can use parentheses to calculate the area of a circle, given its radius:\n"
