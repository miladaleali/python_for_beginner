    "A loop is a programming construct that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly, as long as a certain condition is met. Loops are useful when we want to perform the same task on different values, or when we want to run a task a specific number of times.\n",

    "## for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop is a type of loop that iterates over a sequence of values, such as a string, a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a range. For each value in the sequence, the loop executes a block of code. The syntax of a for loop is:\n",

    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",

    "The `for` keyword is followed by a variable name, which can be any valid identifier. The variable name is followed by the `in` keyword, which is followed by a sequence of values. The sequence is followed by a colon, and then a block of code that is indented by four spaces. The block of code is executed for each value in the sequence.\n",

    "In this example, the loop starts with term equal to 1, and a and b equal to the first two terms of the sequence. The loop iterates until term becomes greater than n, and in each iteration, it prints the value of a, calculates the next term by adding a and b, updates the values of a and b, and increments term by 1. The loop ends when term becomes 11, and the program prints the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence"
